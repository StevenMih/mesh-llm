# Run the real native runtime-event gate against a built native runtime and
# a real model, and write its evidence file.
#
# `crates/skippy-runtime/tests/runtime_events_native.rs` is the only test
# that exercises the reporter against actual native code: install the
# process-global reporter, open a real model, observe structured production
# callbacks, exercise unload, clear the reporter. It is gated behind
# MESH_LLM_RUNTIME_EVENTS_NATIVE_TEST so an ordinary `cargo test` never
# touches a native symbol -- which also meant nothing in CI ever ran it, so
# the whole native reporter path was covered only by whoever remembered to
# run it by hand.
#
# This script is what a CI lane calls. It fails loudly rather than skipping:
# a lane that opts into the gate and then silently passes because a
# prerequisite was missing is worse than no lane at all.
